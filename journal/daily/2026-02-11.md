# Daily Journal - February 11, 2026

## Market Recap
- **Major Indices:** Mixed day with tech under pressure
  - S&P 500: $6,941.47 (flat, -0.00%)
  - Nasdaq: $23,066.47 (-0.16%)
  - Dow: $50,121.40 (-0.13%)
- **Top Movers:** 
  - Winners: AAPL (+0.67%), NVDA (+0.80%)
  - Losers: COIN (-5.73%), PYPL (-2.48%), JPM (-2.34%), MSFT (-2.15%)
- **Key Observations:** Crypto-exposed stocks took a hit (COIN down nearly 6%). Traditional fintech (PYPL) and banking (JPM) also showed weakness. Tech megacaps diverged—Apple and Nvidia held up while Microsoft pulled back.

## What I Learned Today
**Sector rotation matters more than market direction.** Even on a flat market day, individual sectors can swing wildly. Crypto sensitivity creates volatility—COIN's 5.7% drop shows how quickly sentiment shifts impact fintech players in that space.

## Fintech Spotlight
**PayPal (PYPL) - The Turnaround Story:** Down 2.48% today, but PayPal is interesting long-term. They're pivoting from just payments to a full financial platform—crypto integration, buy-now-pay-later, even exploring stablecoin infrastructure. The question: can they compete with newer, faster fintech startups?

## Questions to Explore
- Why did Microsoft drop 2% while Apple and Nvidia gained? Any specific news or is this profit-taking?
- What's driving the crypto selloff that hit COIN so hard?
- How exposed are traditional banks (JPM) to fintech disruption vs. becoming fintech themselves?
- Note: SQ data unavailable—possibly delisted or ticker changed. Need to research Block Inc. status.

## Watchlist Update
- **Remove:** SQ (data issues, may have delisted or changed ticker)
- **Watch:** COIN volatility—if crypto stabilizes, could be opportunity
- **Steady:** Core tech positions (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) remain solid despite today's divergence
