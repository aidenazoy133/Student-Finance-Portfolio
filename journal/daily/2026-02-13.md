friday feb 13, 2026

so today was kind of a mixed bag for the watchlist. most of the big tech names were down but the fintech/crypto stuff actually did pretty well which was interesting.

apple took a beating at 255.78, dropped almost 6 bucks which is like 2.3% down. been reading about how they're dealing with pressure from the trump admin and people are worried about their AI stuff not being as good as competitors. kind of weird timing since they have hardware updates coming up soon. the article mentioned they erased all their year-to-date gains which sucks. PE ratio is 33 which still seems high to me but idk if that matters as much for apple since everyone just buys their stuff anyway.

microsoft and nvidia both down too but not as dramatic. msft only down 52 cents to 401.32 (basically flat), nvda down about 1.6% to 186.94. there's this whole thing happening where people are taking profits from AI stocks and moving money into other sectors especially healthcare. noticed that msft got downgraded by stifel from 540 to 392 which is a massive drop in price target. makes me wonder if analysts are starting to think the AI hype is overdone? but at the same time nvidia's fundamentals still look really strong and they're about to report earnings on feb 25.

jpmorgan was basically unchanged at 302.55, down like 9 cents. banks seem pretty stable right now. one thing i learned is they have a PE of 15 which is way lower than the tech stocks - is that because banking is just less exciting growth-wise or because they're actually undervalued? need to figure that out.

couldn't get data on square tonight for some reason, the site wasn't loading. annoying.

paypal had a decent day up 3% to 40.29. but honestly when you zoom out this stock has been destroyed - it's trading at a 52 week low of like 38 bucks and the high was almost 80. saw something about them having a bad Q4 earnings report and changing CEOs. the PE is only 7.22 which seems insanely low... either it's a value play or something is seriously wrong with the business model. probably the latter if i'm being honest.

the big winner today was coinbase, holy crap. up 16.5% to 164.32 even though they MISSED earnings in Q4. the stock popped because bitcoin is doing well and people are optimistic about "regulatory clarity" which i guess means the government might be more friendly to crypto now? this is confusing because usually when a company misses earnings the stock goes down but i guess crypto stocks are just different. also the beta is 3.7 which is insane - means it's super volatile compared to the overall market.

overall pattern i'm noticing: money is rotating out of the mega cap AI stocks (apple, msft, nvidia) and into other stuff. healthcare is apparently doing really well lately, coinbase obviously, and analysts keep talking about how this rotation is healthy for the market. not sure i fully understand why rotating is "healthy" but i guess it means the market isn't completely dependent on like 3 companies?

questions i still have:
- why does paypal have such a low PE but still dropping? is it a value trap?
- when should you actually sell a stock that's been going down vs holding it?
- how much does one company's earnings really affect the whole sector?
- is the AI hype actually dying or just taking a breather?

need to keep watching how earnings season plays out especially nvidia on the 25th. also want to understand more about what "regulatory clarity" actually means for crypto companies.
