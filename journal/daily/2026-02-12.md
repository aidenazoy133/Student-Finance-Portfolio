# feb 12 market notes

so today was kinda wild tbh. apple got absolutely destroyed, dropped 5% which is like $13.77 to close at $261.73. nasdaq article said something about regulatory concerns and AI delays with siri? honestly not totally clear what happened but when apple drops that much it's usually a big deal since its such a huge part of the market

noticed that nvidia also went down but not nearly as bad, only 1.61% to $186.94. which makes sense i guess since both are tech but nvidia's more of the ai play and apple's more consumer facing. kinda weird how they dont always move together even though theyre both "tech stocks"

but heres what i dont get - jpmorgan was UP today. like significantly up, +3.93% to $322.35. so while tech is getting hammered the banks are doing fine? the article mentioned something about increased bonuses and strong M&A performance. maybe when theres uncertainty in tech people rotate into more stable stuff like banks? or maybe its just that different sectors react to different news

the really interesting thing was coinbase. coin was up 10.21% to $161.04 even though the article said crypto markets are bearish right now. has earnings coming feb 12 (which is today actually). maybe people are betting on good earnings? or maybe its just volatility since it has a crazy high beta of 3.70

trying to understand the sector rotation thing. like when one sector goes down does money automatically flow to another sector or is that too simplistic? because it seems like today money went from tech to financials but idk if thats a pattern or just coincidence

also looked at some numbers - apple P/E is 34.85 which seems high compared to JPM at 16.11. but then nvidia is 46.16 so i guess tech just trades at higher multiples? need to understand why that is. growth expectations maybe?

questions for later:
- why do different sectors have different "normal" P/E ratios
- is sector rotation a real strategy or just something people talk about after the fact
- how much should i weight market cap vs other factors when building a watchlist (apples market cap is 3.8T which is insane)

market felt rough today even though some stuff was green. when the biggest stock drops 5% thats gonna bring everything down. S&P was basically flat ytd at +0.19% according to the apple data

tomorrow need to check: MSFT SQ PYPL (didnt get to those today)
