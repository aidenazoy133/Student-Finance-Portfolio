market's closed obviously since it's the weekend but figured i'd write some thoughts anyway. valentine's day so that's cool i guess, though i spent most of it thinking about last week's market action which is probably not normal lol.

so looking back at this week the main story seems to be this rotation thing everyone keeps talking about. like money moving out of the huge tech stocks and going... somewhere else. healthcare apparently, some fintech stuff, crypto had a crazy day friday. still trying to wrap my head around why this is happening now.

one thing i'm realizing is how much the same companies dominate my watchlist. like 3 of the 7 are just tech giants (apple microsoft nvidia) and they all basically move together. when ai hype is up they're all up, when people get nervous about ai they all drop. is that bad for diversification? probably should look at other sectors but also these are the companies i actually understand and use every day.

been thinking about the paypal situation a lot. it's down so much from its highs and the PE is crazy low at 7.22 but it just keeps dropping. read somewhere that low PE can mean value OR it can mean the company is dying and nobody wants it. how do you tell the difference? like is there a formula or do you just have to understand the business? feels like the answer is probably "understand the business" which means i need to dig deeper into what's actually happening with their earnings and why people are bearish.

also noticed that jpmorgan is super stable compared to everything else. barely moves. PE of 15 vs 33 for apple. is boring actually good when you're trying to build a portfolio? everyone on twitter/x gets hyped about these explosive tech stocks but banks just kind of... exist and make money slowly. which actually might be the point.

the coinbase thing from friday is still wild to me. missed earnings, stock goes up 16%. i get that bitcoin is doing well and that matters more than one quarter, but it still feels backwards. maybe i'm thinking about this wrong - like maybe for crypto stocks the price of bitcoin IS the fundamental and the company's specific numbers matter less? that would explain why it has a beta of 3.7, it's basically just amplified bitcoin exposure.

goals for next week:
- actually look at paypal's earnings report and figure out what's broken
- understand the healthcare rotation thing, maybe find 1-2 healthcare stocks to watch
- nvidia earnings on feb 25, need to pay attention to that. probably the most important event coming up
- try to find stocks outside of tech/fintech so the watchlist isn't so concentrated

random thought: should i be tracking any economic indicators beyond just stock prices? like unemployment, interest rates, that kind of macro stuff? feels like that might help explain the big picture movements but also might be too complicated right now. one step at a time i guess.

anyway market opens again monday so we'll see what happens. hopefully apple doesn't keep tanking because losing 6 bucks in one day is rough.
